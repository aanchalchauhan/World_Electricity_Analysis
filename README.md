# About Dataset
World Electricity Access of all countries since 1960.

Electricity Production across the world by different sources (nuclear , oil , renewable).

Overall transmission loss across the world.

Metadata of all different sources(nuclear, oil, renewable).


# Analysis :
Between 2000 and 2014, there was a significant increase in the accessibility of electricity, with the percentage of people with access to electricity increasing from 78% to 85%. At the same time, there was a substantial reduction in distribution loss, with the percentage of electricity lost during distribution decreasing from 80% to just 13% during this time period.

Regions categorized as lower and lower-middle income tend to have lower rates of electricity access, and this disparity is particularly pronounced between rural and urban areas. In other words, rural areas in these regions are much less likely to have access to electricity than their urban counterparts.

Nuclear sources of energy are a relatively expensive and challenging energy source to acquire for generating electricity, but they are considered one of the most efficient and cleaner sources of energy. High income and upper middle income countries tend to rely more on nuclear sources than on oil due to their higher economic capacity and advanced technological infrastructure.

Oil is a non-renewable source of energy that is cheaper to produce electricity with and easier to acquire. However, producing electricity from non-renewable sources like oil can result in hazardous waste and pollution of the environment. North America and Europe have a greater reliance on nuclear energy, while other regions rely more on oil sources.

By investigating accessibility patterns for various nations, we have found that certain regions or countries have limited access to electricity. This could be due to a lack of infrastructure, limited financial resources, or other barriers to access.

As new technologies and policies are introduced, energy production and consumption patterns are evolving rapidly. With the help of this project we got to know some of these changes, such as the increasing popularity of electric vehicles or the growing use of energy storage systems.

Comparing the production of various power generation sources in different regions it is observed that renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are becoming popular. This may be due to concerns about climate change and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
