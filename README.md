# World_Electricity_Analysis :
This repository contains the analysis of World Electricity Accsessibility and the different sources of electricity prodution for different countries. 

# Objective :
Project objective was to investigate accessibility patterns for various nations. Additionally, it compared the production of various power generation 
sources in different regions. Moreover, it aimed to reveal some of the datasets hidden insights. 

The project's objectives of investigating accessibility patterns, comparing power generation sources, and revealing hidden insights are all critical to understanding the global energy landscape and identifying opportunities for improvement.

# Requirements :
Python, SQL, Power Query, Excel, Power BI

# Insights :
Access to electricity is still a significant challenge in many nations: By investigating accessibility patterns for various nations, we have found that certain regions or countries have limited access to electricity. This could be due to a lack of infrastructure, limited financial resources, or other barriers to access.

Renewable energy production is growing globally: Comparing the production of various power generation sources in different regions it is observed that renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are becoming popular. This may be due to concerns about climate change and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Energy production and consumption patterns are changing rapidly: As new technologies and policies are introduced, energy production and consumption patterns are evolving rapidly. With the help of this project we got to know some of these changes, such as the increasing popularity of electric vehicles or the growing use of energy storage systems.
